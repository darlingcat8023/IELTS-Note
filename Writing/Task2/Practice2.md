**Nowadays, some people think that children have too much freedom. To what extent do you agree or disagree?**

Essay:

Childhood is an unforgettable time for everyone with many people announcing too many free times are given to children. I partly agree this point of view, children should have freedom, but some prerequisites should also be considered. The following paragraphs will provide reasons to support my opinion.

Undeniably, children are full of curiosity at that age, they hope to spend time exploring everything as long as they think are interesting. This kind of performance should be protected and also be encouraged. Their experience of continuing exploration will obviosly strengthen their cognitions instead of restrict their action then instill by oral story. They will benefit from their effort with such exploration when they grow up. However, due to the limitations of children's  early stage of education, they cannot accuratly distinguish between good and bad. Therefore, taking some extra measures is quite necessary.

Guardians should be responsable for children's growth. Based on promising their children free time, they should also filter out some harmful information, such as drug, crime and violence which could misleaded children and potentially developing into juvenile delinquency. For example, drug dealers could harness children's curiosity, leading them taking drugs, bring both irreversiable physical and psychological problems to them. Guardians should be alert for this, correctly leading children into a right way.

In conclusion, having too much freedom for children itself is acceptable, the key controversy is lacking of superviser at same time. If guardians could shoulder on their responsibility, I believe their children will have a illustraious future.
