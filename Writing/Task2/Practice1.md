**Team/group activities can teach more important skills for life than those activities which are played alone. To what extent do you agree or disagree?**

Essay:

Nowdays teamwork is considered a significant skill which leads to one's success. It is also belived widely that team activities contribute more skills than independent ones. I totally agree with this point of view,  the following paragraphs will contain reasons to support my opinion.

Firstly, group work can obviously enhance the ability of cooperation. Group work usually aimed on a same target, to keep participator's effort in a correct direction, communicating with each other is a requied step. Compared to those who usually work alone, members are said to have better interactive ability and grow a stronger sense of community. So the final goal will also achieve easily, this is uncomparable to the single workers.

Secondly, individuals may make mistakes, but they can easily correct them by absorbing information exchanged by others, we can call this self-correct ability. Serious mistakes could result inefficient effort, more effort paid, less goal reached and individuals may could not realise this. Group work establishes a baseline by communication. When errors occur, members can quickly react form this and continually adjust themselves, ensure their effort are directed in a right way.

To sum up, compared to self-reliant tasks, team projects create more chances of promoting self-correct and collaboration skills. Peoples should attent more group activities instead of playing alone, I belive most of them can profit from this kind of skill reinforcements.
