**Nowdays, people are living an increasingly longer life and in many countries there are more old people than young people. Do you agree that the disadvantages of this trend outweigh the advantages**

Essay:

Aging population is becoming a universal topic worldwide with many countries reporting their proportion of older population has already exceeded that taken up by younger population. It is also a controversial issue with some people think we may profit from this, however I disagree with this point of view,  since it causes a series irreversiable problems.

Undeniably, benefit from the improvement of material conditions and medical conditions, people's life has been  extended, however the medical burden has obviously increased as a result of this extension. Due to the healthy problem of olders, crowded on medicial resources is becoming a normalcy. As a solution, government must invest more budgets on this field, including adding medical instruments and expanding hospitals to accommodate the large number of people who need to go to the doctors. These budgets could have been used in other field such as high-tech and nation defence which can truly boost the economy.

Additionally, some professions will also be affected in the long term. The education industry will be affected first, especially early stage of education. The increment of old people means the decent of the young people, the new population could not offset the huge gap, therefore these establishments may collapsed. Secondly, some manufacturers which produce accessories for education may short on orders, they may reduce costs through cutting down employees, thus many people may unemployed.

In general, aging population shows dangers both in short term and long term.
