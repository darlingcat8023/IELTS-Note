**Some people who have been in prison become good citizens later. Some people think that they are the best people to talk to school students the danger of committing a crime. To what extend do you agree or disagree?**

Essay:

Juvenile delinquency is now becoming a universal problem worldwide, many countries report the increasing rate of juvenile delinquency, even in some developed countries, thus it is essential to make students aware of the dangers of crime at an early stage of education. Some people may think that the individuals who have been in prison are the best educators for students, however I disagree with this viewpoint, since the stories they tell have their own limitations.

Undeniably, those who have commited crimes can fully discribe their psychology activities when committing crimes, and the punishments they receive form this. Powerful penalty measures can serve a psychology deterrent to students, and make them afraid of the consequences of committing crimes. But this does not allow students to realize how a crime behavior harms society, they are telling thery stories in their own perspective.

Victims or victim families may be a better choice. They are also expericencers in crime events , they may have suffered from material losses or even departure of their loves during a crime event. Crime brings them long-time suffering to these peoples or families. It totally mainfest how a crime jeopardize a individual, a family or whole society. From these people's perspective, student can develope a real fear of crime behavior, understanding the profound impacts on families and society that often accompany such actions.

In general, not only should students know the wrongness of the criminal behavior itself, but also the students should have a deep understanding of the deep-seated impact of the criminal behavior. Victims may offer the most insightful perspective.
