Examination is a very important activity in modern society, whenever you apply a school or a job. 'Pen and Paper' Examinations are mostly used to test the ability of candidates. Although this method could reflect some feature of the candidates, I still disagree the 'Pen and Paper' Examinations is the unique way to measure intelligence.





Teachers usually acts a very important role during the whole study of a child who spend most time in school, they not only teach knowledge, also how child treat others. So I totally agree with this oppinion, tearchers really have more effacts than parents.
