## Gifts

### 1. Have you ever sent handmade gifts to others?

The most impressive experience I had is that I sent a hand cooked birthday cake to my ex-girlfriend. I'm not good at cooking so I made an appointment with a cake chef. He taught me how to prepare ingredients, how to mix up wheat flour and butter accurately and what tempature should bake the cake. Although the final product didn't reach my exceptations, but she was very happy.

### 2. Have you ever received a great gift?

Well, it is a song called 'A little Happiness'. One of my college classmate sent me this before we graduated. We maintained a very close relationship during the whole studying in college. She stayed there for master's study after graduation, and I move to the North far from her. She sang and recorded this in a studio. It is the best gift I have ever received.

### 3. How to choose a gift?

Choosing a gift may probably a universal challenge. Many factors need to be considered, including gender, relationship, personal preference, budget and more. A meaningful gift reflects the tastes of both sender and receiver. 

### 4. Do you think you are good at choosing gifts?

I'm not good at choosing gifts. In the previous quesetion I emphsized the importance of a meaningful gift. As my common practice, I may usually pick smart gizmos for male friends, lipsticks for female friends and health products for parents.
