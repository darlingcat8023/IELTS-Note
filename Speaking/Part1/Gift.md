## Gifts

### 1. Have you ever sent handmade gifts to others?

The most impressive experience I had is that I sent a hand cooked birthday cake to my ex-girlfriend. I'm not good at cooking so I made an appointment with a cake chef. He taught me how to prepare ingredients, how to mix up wheat flour and butter accurately and what tempature should bake the cake. Although the final product didn't reach my exceptations, but she was very happy.
