## The city you live in

### 1. What city do you live in?

### 2. Do you like this city? Why?

### 3. How long have you lived in this city?

### 4. Are there big changes in this city?

In fact, I never care too much about that. The area where I live is very prosperous, it can satisfy all my needs in this small area, so I barely went to the rest of the city. In addition, I don't like changes, I like to live in a familiar everiroment,  that makes me comfortable.

### 5. Is this city your permanent residence?

It's not my permanent residence city, but I have live here the longest science graduating from collage. The prosperous city really attracted me when I first came here, maybe at that time I thought about residing in this city, but the high house price puts me off. 

### 6. Are there people of different ages living in this city?
