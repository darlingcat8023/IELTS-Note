### 1. What kind of clothes do you like to wear?

Well, it's really a hard question for me. In fact I don't have a fixed preference. It usually depends on the situation, for example if I want to go shopping, I may dress some casual clothes, but in some fomal situation I may dress a suit. My principle is you should be decent in every situation.

### 4. Do you spend a lot of time choosing clothes?

Off course, I think men’s clothes should match their temperament, I should thought what kind of clothes are needed for what occasion. And some innerwear factors should also be considered, for example I'm tall and thin, so if the vertical size is ok and the horizontal size will be a little small and <font color='red'>vice versa</font>. So it uaually spend me a lot of time.
