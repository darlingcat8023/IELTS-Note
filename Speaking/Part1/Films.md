### 1. What films do you like?

In reality, I haven't watched many films. I care more about who directs a film than the category I'm always impressed by movies directed by Nolan. For example his films like "Inception" in 2010, "Dunkirk" in 2017 and "Oppenheimer" in this year, all demonstrate the great success in this domin.

### 2. Did you often watch films when you were a child?

Maybe once a year or even less. I lived in a fourth-tier city when I was a child, the city is not very developed yet. So going to a film was really a luxury.

### 3. Did you ever go to the cinema alone as a child?

Usually with my family. 

### 4. Do you often go to the cinema with your friends?

Not usual, the most common situation is that we can't reach a consensus on what kind of movies to watch. Maybe I would like to watch a documentary, the others may prefer romantic films much. So, we usually go out to dinner together instead.

### 5. Do you think going to the cinema is a good way to spend time with friends?

I'm afraid not. I want to talk about this question from 2 aspects. In the good aspect, a good movie can obviously enhance atmosphere. But in the most important aspect,  one very important principle in cinema is slience. That means you won't be able to communicate with each other. So, I don't think it's a good idea.
