## Robots

### 1. Are robots important?

I think so. Robots play more important roles with the development of industry and artificial intellegence. Robots are precise machines as they designed to make fewer mistakes and enhance efficiency. They can replace humans in many scenarios.

### 2. Would robots affect people's lives?

Off course. In many large and complex industrial equipments, there are always some areas need repaire and maintenance where humans cannot reach. The micro robots can easily get there and detect fauls. This obviously reduces maintenance costs. 

### 3. Have you ever watched a movie about robots?

Really sorry, I can't remember. But I watched promotional videos by an American company called Boston Dynamics. Their robots show great performance.  One impressive clip is when the staff kicked a robot from side, it quickly adjuested the balance to avoid falling. It's really a great deal.

### 4. Should we let a robot drive for us for long journeys?

I think it's a good idea. The auto driving system aggregate data from multi sensors and cameras surround the car. So it can quickly respond contingency in milliseconds, as a comparison, human drivers many need few seconds. So, for safety, I prefer auto driving.

### 5. What can robots do for you at home?

Good question, I think robots can do a lot for me at home. For example, robotic floor cleaner can help cleaning and in a generalized sense, intellengence assistant can also called robots. It can help us control lights and other smart accessories.
