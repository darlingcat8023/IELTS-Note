## Robots

### 1. Are robots important?

I think so. Robots play more important roles with the development of industry and artificial intellegence. Robots are precise machines as they designed to make fewer mistakes and enhance efficiency. They can replace humans in many scenarios.

### 2. Would robots affect people's lives?

Off course. In many large and complex industrial equipment, there are always some areas need repaire and maintenance where humans cannot reach. The micro robots can easily get there and detect fauls. This significantly reduces maintenance costs. 

### 3. Have you ever watched a movie about robots?

Really sorry, I can't remember. But I watched promotional videos by an American company called Boston Dynamics. Their robots show great performance.  One impressive clip is when the staff kicked a robot from side, it quickly adjuested the balance to avoid falling. It's really a great deal.

### 4. Should we let a robot drive for us for long journeys?

I don't think auto driving can replace humans. Though the auto driving in aviation is very mature, it based on prefect navigation systems both on the ground and in the air. The auto driving in cars usually based on their own sensors and cameras surround the car. That means the ability of detecting environment is limited. So, for safety, I prefer human driving.
