### Example

Well, today I want to talk about an unuaual park, it is called 'Xihu Park' in Peking, has the same name with the well-known spot in HangZhou, but much smaller than that one.

It locates at the northeast corner of Peking, besise Peking Capital International Airport Terminal 3, at the end of the middle runway. Actually, it was not initially designed as a park, but a water reservoir, it is used to storage the water during heavy rainfalls, so it keeps the airport from being flooded. With the time goes, It was be refurbished as an artificial park, just as what it is like today.

Every time I take a flight at the Capital Airport, I will arrive 3 hours in advance so that I can walk in the park and take some exciting photos. I'm alse an aviation fan, so I'm interested in many kinds of aircrafts. The park directly faces one of the 3  runways of Capital Airport, if the air traffic control works form south to north, this park is just below the glide slope and heavy aircrafts will fly over your head at very low altitudes. 

It’s an excellent photo spot for aviation fans, as long as the wether is good, fans will gather there with photographic equipments, capture the impressive moments of final approach . It is really an unique experience.
