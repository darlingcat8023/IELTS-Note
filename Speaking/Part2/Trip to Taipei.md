### Example

So today I want to talk about a very special place I have ever gone to in 2015. There are 2 reasons that why I consider it special. Firstly It is a controversial area with someone claiming it belongs to China, and others insist it is an individual country. The second reason is travelling to each other is under a strict restriction for some political reasons. That is the Taiwan Island, and its capital Taipei city.

This plan was launched in 2014, after I visited Australia for 1 month and my ambition really expanded at that time, so I aimed this small island as my next step. However the difficulties exceed my expections. I carefully inqueried about the policies both on Mainland official websites and Taiwan official websites, then I realized I need to prepare 2 required legal documents. For the Mainland acpect, I need to apply a document called 'Two-way Travel Pass to Taiwan' and its corresponding visa. This is valid for Mainland customers only,  and Taiwan does not recognize the legitimacy of this document. So for Taiwan aspect, I need to obtain another permission, called 'Enter-Exit permit for Republic of China'. Both two documents are requied before booking flights. It took me quite a long time. I waited for this trip for nearly one year, and finally achieved at 2015.

Taipei is famous for is 101 Tower, used to be the tallest skyscrape in the world. However it had been exceeded by Khalifa tower in Dubai, but it is still the landmark in Taipei, and also the must visit spot for every travelers. Take the elevator to the 95th floor, an observatory is over there, can overlook the stunning night view of Taipei city. Fisherman's Wharf is also a great place, could enjoy the charming sunset of the Pacific Ocean with many couples taking their wedding photos there.

When I boraded the plane to Taibei, I never would have thought that I would be one of the few lucky people to have visited Taiwan. The application of G visa had stopped since 2019, no individuals could go there any more.
