Well today, I want to talk about a famous baseball player Jackie Robinson. He was born in 1919 and died in 1972. Jackie Robinson is the first non-white player in MLB. I first heart about his story from the MLB official article.

His main archement was made a great contribution to equality. In this aspect, he even changed the history.

Brooklin Dodgers signed him as the first black person to play in MLB and it was really big deal. During his debut in MLB, people was conquered by his outstanding performance. He broke the barrier of segregation.

His story interestes me because it shows that when you don't stop trying, you can achirve great deal. His story also encourage people stand up for fairness.
