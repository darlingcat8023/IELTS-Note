Well today, I want to talk about a famous baseball player Jackie Robinson. He was born in 1919 and died in 1972. Jackie Robinson is the first non-white player in MLB. I first heart about his story from the MLB official article.

He grew up in a time when black and white people were splitted because of their skin color. Even though he faced a lot of unfair treatment because of this, he displayed his talent in sports.

At 1947, the Brooklin Dodgers signed his as the first black person to play in Major League Baseball and it was really big deal. Before this, black players can only played in 'Negro Leagues' and were not allowed to enter the top league. During his debut in MLB, he was abused from opponents, spectators and even his teammate, but he never complainted. Soon people was conquered by his outstanding performance. He broke the barrier of segregation and made a greate contribution to equality. In this regard, he changed the history.

His story interestes me because it shows that when you don't stop trying, you can make great deal. His story also encourage people stand up for fairness.
