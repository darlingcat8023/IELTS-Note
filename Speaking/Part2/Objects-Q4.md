## Describe a rule that is important in your school or at work

You should say:

- What the rule is about
- What happens when people break the rule
- Why you think it is an important rule
- And explain how you feel about the rule

Example

Tody I want to talk about a very important rule in my work. It is called rollback plan. I engaged in IT work, we offer accurate and quick-respond services to customers. When we develop a new release and ready to publish it to production environment. We need to make a detailed rollback plan, this is a required step. The publishing primission won't be granted without a rollback plan.

The system architecture in nowdays IT company has evolutioned from all-in one single service to micro services, that means each service is only responsible for part of function in our system. If there were no such detailed rollback plan, our system will fall into chaos when errors occur, because your data structure may already changed, your data maby flushed, and the dependencies among these microservices may also altered. The rollback plan could guarantee the correctly dealing in this situation.]
