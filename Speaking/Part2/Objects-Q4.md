You should say:

- What the rule is about
- What happens when people break the rule
- Why you think it is an important rule
- And explain how you feel about the rule

Example

Tody I want to talk about a very important rule in my work. It is called rollback plan. I engaged in IT work, we offer accurate and quick-respond services to customers. When we develop a new release and ready to publish it to production environment. We need to make a detailed rollback plan, this is a required step. The publishing primission won't be granted without a rollback plan.

The system architecture in nowdays IT company has evolved from single service to micro services, that means each service is only responsible for specfic function in our system. If there were no such detailed rollback plan, our system will fall into chaos when errors occur, because your data structure may already changed, your data maby flushed, and the dependencies among these microservices may also altered. The rollback plan could guarantee the correct dealing in this situation.

There are tons of lessons behind each rule, their existing is the guarantee to our customers, it' also our most important repsonsibility.
