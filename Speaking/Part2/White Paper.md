### Example

Well, I want to discuss a place that used to have a lot of people in a particular time, it is not only a place itself, it was also a sign of the end of an era. It is Liangma Park in Beijing. The time was December 2022.

At that time, Covid-19 still not stoped spreading in China mainland. They were short on effective MRNA vaccines, and there were no plan to import from overseas. Therefore, a strong isolation measures were taken by authorities and lasting for nearly 3 years, our action was under potent restriction, we need to scan QR code while entering every building. These measures heavily disrupted our daily life and damaged domestic economy.

Then discontent erupted, people gathered there with a white paper raising in hand, to protest against strict isolate measures. They are brave, no matter from which aspect. Soon this activity spread widely via Twitter, more and more people came there, made their own voice. The government did not take strong measures to break up the crowds.

As a finale, they succeed, althouth some people were under arrested after that. All the isolate measures were no longer avaliable soon. Normal life came back. We should thank for their efforts.
