Well, today I want to start my topic with an US aircraft carrier called Robbin in WW2, this ship was quite different form US aircraft carriers,  fully sealed bow with armored flight deck which were main traits of British aircraft carriers. It was truely a British aircraft carrier, serverd for US Navy from December 1942 to September 1943. 

This is a little-known history. The Robbin was originally the third ship of the British Illustrious-class aircraft carrier, Victorious. There were 3 fleet carriers commanded by USS in Pacific. But after Battle of Santa Cruz, Hornet was sunk by Japanese bomber, Saratoga and Enterprise were all badly damaged by torpedo, that means no carries could use to resist the Japanese Navy. So the Victorious was loaned to the US Navy and changed the radio call sign Robbin.

The first time I knew this history was from Wiki. To my surprise, their were no Chinese documents about this, so people rarely know this period. I want to translate the English documents, contribute to Chinese website. Let more people know this interesting history.
