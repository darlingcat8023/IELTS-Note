### Example:

Well, today I want to talk about an unusual dinner, we called Graduation Dinner. This graduation means graduating form senior high school, after we accomplished our gaokao.

In Chinese education system, students take too much stress from primary school till college. In some province, nearly one million students take the college entrance examination every year. The competition is quite drastic, who is more diligent, who will success. During the whole study in senior high school, we usually wake up at 6 in the morning, and back home at 11 in the evening. Although it is indeed very hard, I still feel very happy at that moment.
