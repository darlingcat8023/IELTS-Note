An expensive gift that I would love to give someone when I've saved a large amount of money is a luxury watch. When I first came to the shop for previewing, I was impressed by its fantistic design. This is a German Made laxury watch provided by Grasutti, dark green dial with rose golden shell and dark green strap. I would like to give this gift to my parents. They paid a lot when I grew up, thay also abandend their own preference to help me study more efficiently and they rarely complaint on me. So since I started working, I want to repay them with this gift using my salary.
