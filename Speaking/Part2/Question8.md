An expensive gift that I would love to give someone when I've saved a large amount of money is a luxury watch. When I first came to the shop for previewing, I was impressed by its fabulous design. 

This is a German Made luxury watch provided by Glashutte, it has dark green dial with rose golden case and dark green crocodile strap. It also provide power reserve function in a sub-dial positioned at top-right corner of the dial.

The market price is approximately 160,000 RMB, and my salary is 3,0000 RMB per month. So it would take me about half a year to save for this luxury. My finances are healthy,  so It won't be a big problem.

I would like to give this gift to my parents. They paid a lot when I grew up, thay also abandend their own preference to help me study more efficiently and they rarely complaint on me. So since I started working, I want to repay them with this gift using my salary. I thought they must love it very much.
