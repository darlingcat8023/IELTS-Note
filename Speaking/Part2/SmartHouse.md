### Example:

Well, I want to talk about an exciting house I would like to have. These follwoing factors could impact my choice. 

The Firs factor is physical location. I think my house should be in a big city, not too far from downtown, the area should be prosperous, surrouing with business complexes. So if I want to enjory my leisure time or go out for meals, this location may give me more choice. In addition, I lover a flat more than a villa, preferably on a high floor, so it can keep away form some insects, especially annoying mosquitoes in summer.

Secondly, I want to mention some furnitures. I like simple style, such as some brands in IKEA. Pure white color with exquisite design suites me very much. And the most important thing is the house should equip smart accssaries. In the house I living now, there are some Nanoleaf smart lights I bought them from Apple, can be remote controled on phones. So when I lying on  the bed, and ready for sleeping, I no longer need to touch the physical switch. So I want more accssaries, inculding electric curtains, and digital assistant, so I can control everything my voice.
