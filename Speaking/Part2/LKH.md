### Example

Well, today I want to talk about my team leader in my previous company. His name is LKH, we could use his code name fox instead.

He finished his bachelor's study in England, and Master's study in Singapore. He speaks a fluent English with British accent. He was the interviewer when I first came to this company. He is a good talker, always showes his enthusiasm and kindness. This is also the reason why I decided to join this company. He led a IT team,  we develop a education system together. We alwayse complain about the intensity of work, because our business demands ofen updated then we may missed the dead line.
