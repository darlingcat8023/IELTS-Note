### Example

Well, today I want to talk about a professional football player Didier Drogba. He started his career in France, then joined Chelsea Football Club in England in 2004. He is famous for his strong body, almost no one can gain the upper hand in a confrontation with him. After his transfer to Chelsea, He gradually became the best striker in the world.

He is indefatigable. In the 2008 UEFA Champions League Final against MU, He was sent off by a red card. This is his first Champoins League final, also the teams. In the panelty shootout, He should have taken the last penalty kick, but Terry, who replaced him, missed the panelty, and also missed the champion. Next year in semi final against Barcelona, the referee made a series of controversial penalties and finally failed to enter the finals. He was 31 years old, and his career nearly came to the end. But luckly in 2012 final, he scored a crucial goal, his team beat the Byren.
