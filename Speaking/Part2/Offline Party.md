Well, today I want to talk about an unusual party / activity held by Chelsea Football Fan club. It was 2021, after England football club Chelsea beaten Real Medrid from Spain in semi finals of UEFA Champions League with the score 3-1 in April. So the fan club in Beijing dicided to held an offline party for the upcomming Champions League final against Bayern Munich.

At that time the Covid-19 virus was still wildly spreaded. So finding an appropriate venue was quite difficult. We should have reported to the police station and attempted to get their permission. Then we should seek for some sponsors, because our budget was insufficient. Finally one of our sponsors would like to provide a venue, It was initially designed as a convention center that can accommodate approximately 500 people, with a huge screen for casting. It located at 798 art park outside of Beijing East Fourth Ring Road. We also customize some souvenirs for participators, we got in touch with the manufacturer, one of them was the cans of pepsi replaced with a new livery, , and print some meaningful words on this new livery. 

The result of the match also makes us happy. Chealse beats Man City with the score 1 nil, and win the Champions League for the second time.
