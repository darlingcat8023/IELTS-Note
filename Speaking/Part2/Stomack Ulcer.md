### Example

Well, I want to talk about an unusual time I have ever experienced. After my diet has become regularly. I first want to tell you some backgrounds, I was diagnosed a heavy stomach ulcer at 2021, the doctor told me that I should keep away from alchol and cigarettes, also reduce the uptakes of spicy food. In addition, I must take pills every day on time. 

One day after a dinner, I have a sharp pain in my lower abdomen, this extent is much heavy then previous. I couldn't stand, I could only bend over. So my roommate called a taxi and sent me to hospital. After blood test and CT scanning, the doctor confirmed that I catched a stomack perforation. By normal situation, I should have surgery.

The doctor may be a beginner, he didn't realise the severity of this problem. He initially predicated as a typical stomack spasm, injected only painkiller for me. Then he leaved me in the hospital for a whole night observation. He was wrong in actually, that was not a spasm, it was a perforation. The rotating doctors told me the truth after he carefully analyzed my CT result.

Luckly, I only lay on the hospital for one week with a tube inserting through the nose into the stomach, used for exporting liquid in stomack. This incident finally changed my diet. Make me eat more regularly.
