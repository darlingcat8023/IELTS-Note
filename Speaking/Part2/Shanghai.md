Well, today I want to talk about an unusual experience in Shanghai, I nearly lost my way.

It happened in 2014 after summer holiday. I was a student in collage at that time. I was living in Dalian, and my college was in Changsha, I need to return to campus and prepare for my next semester. So I booked a connecting flight from Dalian to Changsha, transfer in Shanghai. This was much cheaper than direct flights.

Then mistake came up. After I landed at PVG airport. I went to domestic departure, and tried to find the imformation of my next flight. But nothing could found. I was quite confused, because my ticked was confirmed by both booking platform and airline company. The flight didn't vanished for no reason. Then I opened my flight app, I found the mistake, the next flight was  at Hongqiao Airport. This was my first time in Shanghai. I didn't know there are 2 airports in Shanghai. Luckily, there were still planty of time left, I went to the information desk and asked the fastest way to Hongqiao Airport, and finally arrived on time.
