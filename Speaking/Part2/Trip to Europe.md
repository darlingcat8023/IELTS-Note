### Example

So today, I want to talk about a place that I have longed for for a long time, and haven't yet come to, that is the Nordern Europe, specifically Scandinavia peninsula, includinig Finland, Norway and Sweden.

This thaught started since 2016, at that year I registed the Instagram, followed a lot interesting peoples there, a young boy posted a photo at Finland then attracted me. The photo shows a magnificent nature phenomenon that only appears at high latitude area, we called Nordern Lights, but I usually use another romantic name, Aurora. At that time I decided that I must see the Aurora with my own eyes. So I started to plan this trip, I just graduated from collage at that time, so I need to work first to accumulate some savings. By late 2019, I felt that was  the time, I prepared to apply my vistor visa and search  for flights and accommodations. There was direct flight from Beijing to Helsinki,  captail of Finland. Unfortunately, the Covid-19 occurred, It impacted nearly the whole world, the flight suspended and entry and exit were also restricted, so I had to stop this plan. 

It's really a pity, I applied a master's study in New Zealand, so there won't be any chance to visit there in next 3 years.
